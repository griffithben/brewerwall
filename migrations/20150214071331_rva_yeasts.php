(201,'Mangrove Jack\'s','M79','Burton Union Yeast','Famous the world over for its crisp, dry and uniquely malty and hoppy ales, this strain has been isolated and developed especially for the home and craft brewer from a commercial brewery in the heartland of British Brewing. Burton Union Yeast is a gentle but rapid fermenter that generates light and delicate ripe pear esters and does not strip away light malt character or body. Moderate acidity balances the silky smooth texture of beers fermented with this strain. When hops or malt aromas are stronger, the yeast contribution will be neutral. When used in lighter quality malt bases, the hops and esters are able to shine. Beers made with this yeast are quick to condition, giving you great beer in as little as 3 weeks.',75,80,'High',62,74,0,'Dry'),
